### Slot Machine Extravaganza Game Rules(ChatGPT)

#### Introduction
Welcome to the "ðŸŽ° Slot Machine Extravaganza ðŸŽ°", where matching 3 symbols can bring you great wins, including a special 333 jackpot!

#### Starting the Game
- Begin by deciding how much money you want to insert into the slot machine.
- Enter the amount you wish to play with. The game rounds your input to the nearest hundredth.

#### Gameplay Mechanics
1. **Initial Bet**: Deduct your bet from your total money. You must have enough funds to play.
2. **Playing Rounds**: Each play reduces your choice amount by $1.00. The game generates three random numbers (between 1 and 3) for the slot machine.
3. **Jackpot**: The starting jackpot is $10.00 and increases after each round if there's no winner.
4. **Special Jackpot Chance**: Occasionally, you'll get a chance to bet for a special jackpot. You can bet any amount, but it must not exceed your current funds. If your bet is successful, your potential win is triple your bet.
5. **Winning**: 
   - If all three slot machine numbers match, you win.
   - A special win occurs if the numbers are all 3s and your win amount is more than $5.00, multiplying the jackpot.
   - Otherwise, you win the current jackpot or the amount based on your bet.
6. **Continuing Play**: After each round, you can choose to play again if you have at least $1.00. If not, you need to reload your funds.

#### Ending the Game
- The game ends when you decide to stop playing or when you run out of funds.
- If you run out of funds, you have an option to reload your account to continue playing.
- Any unhandled exceptions or invalid inputs will take you back to the main menu.

#### Important Notes
- Always monitor your balance to ensure you have enough funds to continue playing.
- Enjoy the game responsibly and remember it's just a simulation! ðŸŒŸðŸ˜ŠðŸŒŸ
